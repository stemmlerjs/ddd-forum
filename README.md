> A [SOLID](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/) hackernews-inspired forum site built with TypeScript using the [clean architecture](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/) and [DDD best practices](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/).

![DDDForum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6892666/67032446-9931db00-f0e1-11e9-894d-7bccd240c851.png)

## About 

DDDForum.com is the application that we build in [solidbook.io - The Software Design and Architecture Handbook](https://solidbook.io). 

## Running the project

1. Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) if you haven't already.
2. Copy the `.env` template file. Feel free to change passwords and app secrets. 

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

3. Build and run the image to run the backend services.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

4. Open up an additional console and then run:

```bash
npm run setup:dev
npm run start:both
```

You can visit the app by going to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Demo 

[You can visit the site here](https://dddforum.com).

> `Note`: It's currently deployed on free tier Heroku, which has some undesirable side-effects like shutting off the server during periods of inactivity. So if it's down for you, refresh a couple of times. Thinking about migrating this to a serverless architecture later on.

### Built with

#### Backend

- [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) - The ORM for Node.js
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Lightweight webserver
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - For holding onto JWT tokens and refresh tokens

#### Frontend

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Architecture

We built this based on the [Clean Architecture](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/), [SOLID principles](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/), and [Domain-Driven Design](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) best practices using TypeScript.

#### Clean architecture

There's obviously a lot that went into building this from front to back.

The **Clean Architecture** is a way to reason about where different types of application logic belongs. 

<img width="1586" alt="Frame 8 (1)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6892666/66703014-dc540e80-ecdb-11e9-81ac-9cc24e28f8c3.png">


There's a lot more to learn about the clean architecture, but for now- just know that it's a way to really separate the concerns of everything that goes into building complex enterprise applications. You'll never see any `infrastructure`-related code alongside `domain` layer code.

The clean architecture, when combined with Domain-Driven Design, is very powerful :) 

In DDD, we build applications on top of a number of subdomains.

##### Subdomains

> A _subdomain_ is a cohesive unit of code that represents exactly one core concept and is responsible for a specific set of concerns in an application architecture. For example, every application has a `users` subdomain. That's responsible for _users, identity & access management, authentication, authorization, etc_. Sometimes you don't want to build that yourself. Sometimes you can go with an off-the-shelf solution like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). But there are subdomains in your application that you cannot simply outsource. These are the **family jewels**; the thing that's actually _novel_ about your app. This is the subdomain that no one (except you) can code. Know why? Because only _you_ have the domain knowledge to build it exactly the way that it should be built. You understand the domain. 

In DDDForum, we have 2 **subdomains**: The `users` subdomain and the `forum` subdomain.

<img width="855" alt="Frame 3 (1)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6892666/66702871-4a97d180-ecda-11e9-9a80-19755dc1f0a9.png">

Each subdomain has a:

- `domain` layer: where the highest-level policy, domain objects, and domain rules belong (`user`, `email`, etc)
- `application` layer: where the use cases / features that utilize domain objects belong (`createUser`, `login`, etc)
- `adapter` layer: where we define abstractions so that `application` layer code can interact with `infrastructure` layer concepts, without actually requiring on `infrastructure` (because that would break the [dependency rule](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/dependency-rule/)). Here we write things like `IUserRepo` - repository adapter, `IJWTTokenService` - an abstraction of a cache (redis) that manages tokens, etc.
- `infrastructure` layer: where we create [concrete](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/concrete-class/) implementations of the abstractions from the `adapter` layer so that they can be spun up at runtime thanks to the power of polymorhpism :) (more on this later).

> If you haven't already, I recommend you read [this article](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/application-layer-use-cases/) on use cases and subdomains.

Let's identify some of the actual concepts that exist in each subdomain.

### `users` subdomain

In the` users` subdomain, we're only concerned with concepts that are related to authentication, roles, etc. Here are a few examples of classes and concepts that exist at each layer.

- `domain` layer: `user` ([aggregate root](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/aggregate-design-persistence/)), `userEmail` ([value object](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-value-object/)), `userCreated` ([domain event](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/chain-business-logic-domain-events/)).
- `application` layer: `createUserUseCase` ([use case](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/application-layer-use-cases/)), `getUserByUserName` (use case).
- `adapter` layer: `IUserRepo` ([respository](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/repository-dto-mapper/) interface adapter)
- `infrastructure` layer: `SequelizeUserRepo` (a concrete implementation of the IUserRepo), `UserDTO` ([data transmission objects](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/repository-dto-mapper/)).

### `forum` subdomain

In the `forum` subdomain, we're only concerned with concepts that have to do with building a forum. You won't see any domain concepts from the `user` in `forum`. In the `forum` subdomain, the concept most equivalent to a `user`, is a `member`.

Here are a few examples of concepts from the `forum` subdomain.

- `domain` layer: `member`, `comment`, `post`, `postVote`, `commentVote`, `commentVotesChanged`
- `application` layer: `replyToComment`, `getMemberByUserName`,  `upvotePost`, `downvotePost`
- `adapter` layer: `ICommentRepo`, `IPostRepo`, `IMemberRepo`
- `infrastructure` layer: `SequelizeCommentRepo`, `SequelizePostRepo`, `SequelizeMemberRepo`

Here's a large-scale visualization of the repo. As I put more time into the front-end, it may change a little bit.
